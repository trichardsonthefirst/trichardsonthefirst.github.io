## Osaka Bikepacking Adventure

After arriving in Osaka on October 15th, 2024, I began my bikepacking journey through this vibrant city. The streets were bustling with people, and the weather was perfect for cycling.

### Highlights of the Trip:
- **Shinsaibashi**: Navigating through the busy streets filled with neon lights and shopping arcades.
- **Osaka Castle**: A must-see, the castle was surrounded by beautiful gardens perfect for a quick stop.
- **The Ride Along the Yodo River**: A smooth and scenic route that provided a break from the urban chaos.
- **Food**: Osaka is famous for its street food, and I couldn't resist grabbing some Takoyaki along the way.

### The Route:
I started near **Namba** and cycled north, following the Yodo River to **Kyoto**. Along the way, I met a few fellow cyclists who showed me some off-the-beaten-path routes.

### Thanks to Erik
Special thanks to Erik for saving me from riding a too-small M-sized frame and helping me find the perfect fit for my bike in Japan!
